# hello-world


Thanks for not making fun of my first sample project!
I'm a 37 yr old finance professional and I think i want to teach myself how to code. Am i crazy? My good friend Mark thinks i'll be a natural. We will see!

First branch edit complete, not trying again to see if i remembered how to do it!
